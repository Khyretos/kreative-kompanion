1. (2026-10-01) Templates: only the escaping `html` tagged template; nested `html` values and arrays of them are fine. Never `innerHTML`, never `.join("")` on `html` arrays (it escapes the markup).
2. (2026-10-01) Clicks go through `onAction` with `data-action`; it calls `preventDefault`, so radio buttons and checkboxes must use the `change` event instead of `data-action`.
4. (2026-10-03) `tsc` fails the build on unused imports: remove them.
6. (2026-10-03) Never pass a function with optional extra parameters straight to `.map()` (it receives the index as the second argument): `.map((c) => row(c))`.
7. (2026-10-03) Map names with a lookup table (`Record<string, string>`), not chained `.replace()` calls: those also hit substrings.
8. (2026-10-03) Never inline event handlers (`onchange="..."`): the CSP blocks them and they bypass `onAction`. Forms are handled by the shell's submit listener.
9. (2026-10-03) In `${cond ? list.map(...) : html`...`}` the `}` comes after the whole ternary; a stray `)}` after the map closes the expression early (tsc: "':' expected").

10. Before you output a file, count the braces of the last function. An extra `}` at the end
    of a module is a syntax error that breaks the whole build. When told to remove one, check
    the last 3 lines of your output.
11. Never make the user refresh (Kees, standing rule). Every action that changes data
    updates the store at once (optimistic), rolls back with an error toast on failure,
    and disables its button with a spinner while pending. Live changes from the server
    arrive over the `/api/events` SSE stream. Each page has a Playwright test that does an
    action and checks the screen without reloading.
12. Code you are given "at module level" or "after the function" stays outside the function.
    State that two exported functions share (like a `busy` Set) must be declared at the top
    level of the module, or the second function can't see it.
14. When you remove lines with an edit block, SEARCH for exactly those lines. Never include the
    line that opens the surrounding block (`test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {`) unless the
    REPLACE keeps it.
16. `null` is not `undefined`. A field typed `string | null` needs a truthiness check (`!!a.result`)
    or `?? ""`, never `!== undefined`; otherwise a string function gets `null` and the whole
    render throws, so nothing shows.
17. `html``…`` drops`false`:`aria-pressed="${x === y}"` renders `aria-pressed=""` when false.
    Write `aria-pressed="${String(x === y)}"` for every true/false attribute (Assets chips, 2026-10-04).
42. (2026-10-04) Never mutate store items in place, even when it looks harmless: replace the
    object (`items.map((x) => x.id === id ? { ...x, done: true } : x)`), or keyed updates miss it.
43. (2026-10-04) Union-typed fields in helper return types: use `Pick<Type, "a" | "b">`, not `string`.
46. (2026-10-04) Boolean attributes in `html` templates: `${x ? "selected" : ""}`, never `${String(x)}`.
113. (2026-10-07) Arrays of `html` pieces go into a template as they are: never `.join("")` (the string is escaped and shows as markup). Values per item are computed inside the `map` callback, not as functions used like arrays (CHAT-03b).
114. (2026-10-07) A `<details>` that must stay open across `mount()` re-renders: read the DOM's open state when rendering; the toggle event is async and lost when the element is replaced first (CHAT-03b).
118. (2026-10-08) A handler run by `onAction` that returns a Promise must not set `disabled` itself: the busy marker re-enables the button when the Promise settles. Show the result by replacing the button (a chip such as "Created"). A new composer slot must be added to the phone rule `.composer-hint > :not(...)` or it is hidden below 760px (OVR-01).
    Use only icon names that exist in `views/icons.ts`. One small function per template branch.
